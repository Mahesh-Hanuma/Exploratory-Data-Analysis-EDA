# 🏠 MagicBricks EDA Project: Housing Data Analysis  

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the MagicBricks housing dataset to uncover patterns in property prices, locations, sizes, and amenities. The goal is to provide insights that help understand the housing market trends across multiple cities in India.  

---

## 🎯Project Goal  
The main objectives of this analysis are to answer questions like:  

- What is the average property price in different cities?  
- How does price vary with the number of bedrooms (BHK) and square footage?  
- Which cities have the highest property demand?  
- Is there a clear trend between price, location, and amenities?  
- What features most influence housing prices?

## 🔎 How It Works  

### **1. Data Collection**  
- Raw housing data was collected from MagicBricks (multi-city).  
- Files include both **raw** and **cleaned datasets**.  

### **2. Data Inspection**  
- Checked for missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant columns.  
- Identified data types for numerical and categorical features.  

### **3. Data Cleaning**  
- Removed duplicates and unnecessary symbols.  
- Handled missing values using mean/median imputation.  
- Standardized columns like *Price*, *BHK*, *Area (sqft)*.  

### **4. Data Exploration**  
- Analyzed distributions of prices, BHK, and square footage.  
- Studied relationships between property features and prices.  
- Compared average housing prices across multiple cities.  

### **5. Data Visualization**  
- Created bar charts, boxplots, histograms, and heatmaps.  
- Visualized how **location**, **BHK**, and **area size** affect property price.  
- Highlighted city-level comparisons and outlier trends.
